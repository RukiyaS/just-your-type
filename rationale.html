Rationale

My chosen concept was a quote a found online. I used this quote because the quote could be broken up into parts and still make sense, which made it great for this project since there needed to be changes between the different screens sizes.
I chose these typefaces because they are dratically different,however they still visually balance each other. I used the thin cursive font for the Learn, Live, Hope because those when you read those words they make you feel light and joyful.
I used a thick font for the Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow to make bold impact and a thinner version of the same font on the other words because they are least important.
I chose this type scale because the font size and line height was ideal size for the layout and look I wanted to achieve with this concept.
I chose this salmon pink colour for the background because the light and warmness of the colour matches the meaning of this quote and I left the text white to make it stand out against the background colour.
I effectively used the grids and modular css by using the modular css to center the text and using the grid css to make words appear on designated screen sizes.
The challenges I overcomed while doing this was getting all the text to be centered when words appear on each screen size and getting the small "and" to sit leveled with the "Today" on the large screen size.
